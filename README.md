#Goals of this exercise

My main intentions going into this process were to learn the following:
  -Learning to navigate the my computer using the CMD
  -Learning to use the git tool to create and push commits to a gitHub repository via the CMD
  -Learning to read and clean csv datasets via python with the pandas and numpy library

##Steps I took to complete this exercise

  -My first step was simply learning a bit of the DOS syntax to navigate my computer with the command
  -I then used the pip tool to install git
  -I created a gitHub repository to use for the project
  -I then initialized a git and began learning the commands to add, commit, and push gits to my repository using a remote
  -I downloaded the sample dataset and followed an online tutorial to read and clean the data using Python
  -Throughout my time completing this exercise I pushed commits to my repository every few lines of code added.
  -Finally I created this README to push to my repository to explain this project
