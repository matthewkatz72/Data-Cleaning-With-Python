# Goals of this exercise

My main intentions going into this process were to learn the following:
+ Learning to navigate the my computer using the CMD
+ Learning to use the git tool to create and push commits to a gitHub repository via the CMD
+ Learning to read and clean csv datasets via python with the pandas and numpy library

## Steps I took to complete this exercise

1. My first step was simply learning a bit of the DOS syntax to navigate my computer with the command
2. I then used the pip tool to install git
3. I created a gitHub repository to use for the project
4. I then initialized a git and began learning the commands to add, commit, and push gits to my repository using a remote
5. I downloaded the sample dataset and followed an online tutorial to read and clean the data using Python
6. Throughout my time completing this exercise I pushed commits to my repository every few lines of code added.
7. Finally I created this README to push to my repository to explain this project
